🚀 Ilmi Kitabi - Enterprise-Grade Book Exchange Platform

A robust desktop application built with Java and MySQL, implementing industry-standard design patterns and software engineering principles.

📋 Project Overview:
Comprehensive peer-to-peer book management system enabling students to lend, borrow, buy, sell, and exchange books through a secure, admin-supervised platform.

🏗️ Architecture & Design:
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for separation of concerns
- GRASP patterns: Controller, Creator, Information Expert, Low Coupling, High Cohesion
- DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for database abstraction
- Singleton pattern for database connections
- Observer pattern for notifications

💻 Technical Implementation:

Frontend:
- JavaFX for responsive, modern UI
- 15+ custom views with consistent design language
- Real-time data updates and live statistics
- Form validation and error handling
- Dynamic content rendering

Backend:
- Java SE with OOP principles
- Business Logic Layer with controller classes
- Service layer for authentication and notifications
- Model classes representing domain entities

Database:
- MySQL with 12-table normalized schema
- Foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity
- Optimized queries with JOIN operations
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Prepared statements preventing SQL injection
